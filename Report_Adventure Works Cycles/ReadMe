The AdventureWorks database is a sample database initially introduced by Microsoft for beginners to learn SQL Server with the sample data and database objects like the tables, indexes, triggers, stored procedures, functions, etc. It is meant for standard online transaction processing scenarios. This sample database and the data is developed for a fictional bicycle company called Adventure Works Cycles.

I used the datasets to study Microsoft Power BI and to practice its tools. As a result, I have created a final interactive report that includes executive summary, product and client details. To create the report, I connected and prepared raw data, built a relational data model, created new calculated columns and DAX measures, and created an interactive report for data analysis and visualization.
